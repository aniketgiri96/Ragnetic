# User Personas

| Persona | Role | Primary goal | Pain point |
|---------|------|--------------|------------|
| **Priya** | Engineering lead | RAG API for an internal chatbot | LangChain is too complex; no ready-made production pipeline |
| **Marcus** | HR manager | Chat with policy docs without IT help | Current tools require developer support |
| **Sofia** | IT admin | Deploy and manage a multi-team KB platform | Most tools lack access control and audit logs |
| **Arjun** | Open-source developer | Contribute to and extend the platform | Poor docs and opaque codebases block contribution |

These personas drive priorities: API-first and production-ready pipeline (Priya), simple UI and self-service (Marcus), RBAC and observability (Sofia), and documentation and contribution flow (Arjun).
